# RedGreenBlue

RedGreenBlue is a native iOS application I developed which works with Philips Hue lights (https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us).  The application allows the user to create what are called 'Dynamic Scenes', allowing the lights to change colors automatically without user interaction! Users can pick which colors they want, the time interval between color changes, and more.

## Initial startup
During initial startup the user needs to connect the app to their Hue Bridge.  First, the user's phone must be connected to the same WiFi that the Hue Bridge is connected to in order for the application to find it. Once the application finds the Hue Bridge, the user then presses the physical button on the bridge to connect to that specific bridge.  Users may have multiple bridges in their home which have different lights registered to them. Connecting to multiple bridges is supported after intial startup as well as the ability to change between them.

## Home Screen
The home screen displays your light groups!  These groups are divided into two categories. 'Rooms' which are created when registering Philips Hue lights for the first time to the bridge using the official Philips Hue app. And 'Groups' which are custom subsets of all of your Philips Hue lights. For instance you may two rooms, living room and family room, you can create a group which has lights from both, or one, or the other.  Here you are able to turn on light groups, adjust brightness levels, and navigate into groups to change individual light colors.

## Changing colors
Changing colors is done using the color wheel! There are also numerous preset color swatches that the user can pick from. You can get to this view by navigating to a particular light, or tapping on the color wheel to change all lights of a group to the same color.  This same color picker is used when adding colors to Dynamic Scenes.

## Dynamic Scenes
Dynamic scenes are created from the dynamic scenes tab. This view shows a list of all the dynamic scenes that the user created, as well as any default ones which are created for you.  Tapping the '+' sign at the top right allows the user to create a new dynamic scene.

Here the user has a wide array of options to change. They can name their new scene, change which colors are associated with it, change how often it cycles between colors, and even changing the brightness.

When the user is done creating their dynamic scene they can save it.  It will then be added to the list where they are able to play it!

The user can always go back later to change or delete the scene if they wish.

Some basic settings are also available, allowing the user to find and connect to more Hue Bridges, swapping between connected bridges, and on iOS 13+ changing to dark mode!
